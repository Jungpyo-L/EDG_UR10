# EDG Robot Control ROS Package (Node/Python)

## Objective
The objective of this package is to regroup in one place every modules useful for the control of EDG's UR-10 robotic arm with RTDE controller. This package also expose a launch file that is useful to quickstart all programs related to the control of the arm. THe main functions of this package is to move the UR robot to desired pose and recording data (robot pose, ATI F/T, ect.).

## How to use the launch file?
The included launch file takes care of loading the appropriate robot description, the parameters and the configuration of the UR-10 arm through the usage of the [universal_robot](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot) ROS package. Furthermore, this launch file spawn an instance of [MoveIt](https://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/index.html), again using the files coming with the [universal_robot](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot) package. Finally, this launch file also spawn an instance of the [rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz/UserGuide) program which let's the user see a virtual robot with its environment as well as allowing to interact with the robot.

Ethernet connection for an experiment. The RealTek Ethernet Connected (wriless connection) must connect to UR10 Robot.

The first launch file takes a single argument which is the IP address of the robot. By default, a direct connection is assumed and the IP address of 10.0.0.1 is assumed to be the one of the robot. Also, this launch file excutes rviz to see the current and desired robot pose. As all launch files, the usage is pretty simple:
```bash
roslaunch edg_ur10 ur_control.launch
```

The Second launch file is mainly for data-logging. It launches data logger and visual rqt for real-time force torque readings.
```bash
roslaunch edg_ur10 ur_experiment.launch
```

## Simple robot control (example: simple_robot_control.py)
This script is to demonstrate a simple robot move from point A to B with a goToPose function. The speed and acceleration of the UR robot can be changed when rtde_helper 

```bash
rosrun edg_ur10 simple_robot_control.py
```

## data log (example: simple_data_log.py)
Topic list
```bash
rosrun edg_ur10 simple_data_log.py
```

## How does it work?
The principal script uses three different [Python modules](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html) in order to work. Each of these modules have a specific purpose.

### The robot_control module
The objective of this module is to send commands to the robot such that it moves as intended. To do so, three main functions can be used: goRelOrientation, goRelPosition and goPose. The first is used to move the wrist of the robot by a number of degrees. The second is used to translate the robot end effector in space relative to its current position and following the world reference frame. The third function is used to command the robot to go to a specific precomputed pose.

Although it would be entirely possible to calculate the destination pose relative to the world reference frame and to use exclusively the goPose function, it would also make things more complicated than what is required for most common tasks. An easier workflow would be:
1) Use the teach pendant to reach the desired position.
2) Run the PrintCurrentPose.py script in order to generate the lines of code needed to reach that position/orientation.
3) In your program, use the previously generated lines of code to instruct the robot to reach that chosen pose.
4) Then translate the end effector using the goRelPosition function.
5) Then, if needed, change the orientation of the end effector using the goRelOrientation function.
6) Rinse and repeat the last two steps as needed.

### The scene_manager module
This module is used to manage the virtual scene in which MoveIt controls the robot. This scene defines objects in which the robot should not collide. Therefore it defines additional contraints that MoveIt should respect while trying to solve the optimisation problem that is path planning. For the moment, all objects are made of a number of boxes although other geometric primitives could be used.

### The helperFunction module
This module's primary purpose is to make the main code simple by integrating all helper functions related to robot control and data logging
